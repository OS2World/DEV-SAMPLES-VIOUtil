// this file should be edited to contain a list of the procedures
// to be placed in the QH database.  The name after the .context
// should be consistant with the .category name in the individual
// modules and should match the name given in the wshelp.doc file 
// for this context.  That is the link backwards from the module to 
// this list.  The .category command in this file is the link 
// backwards to wshelp.doc, and should contain an ordinal for the 
// position in the wshelp.doc list of the "cursor" that you wish 
// the display to be positioned in the wshelp list. ( huh? )  The
// .topic command should match the name given in the .context command.
