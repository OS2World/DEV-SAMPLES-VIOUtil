This zip file contains several routines used to interface with the user in a
VIO type of world.  There are several routines wich draw/erase boxes and a POP
util that creates a VIO POPUP with data in it.  The popup.zip file is a
application level use of the pop.c routine.  You will need to make sure that
the make files all point to the proper places on your system to allow them to
be compiled.  The make file for the vioutils portion of this code is called
vioutil. ( clever huh ?)   In popup.zip is another make file called popup.
